# Description:
The objective of this repo is to introduce the reader to Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems. Among other things, CBIR allows you to search for images similar to a query image in an image database. This similarity is calculated not on the images themselves but through a description (descriptor) used by whoever designed the system. 

## an overview of a CBIR system:
